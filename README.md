## Overview

This is a modified version of the standard EmoStateLog written with the Java wrapper, which interfaces with the Emotiv EPOC BCI.

EmoRecord allows users to collect all emotional data recorded by the Emotiv Control Panel.

Selected emotional data is written to a csv placed in the project's root directory.

The uploaded project can be easily imported by Eclipse.
